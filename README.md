Process-logger is a hybrid code/document/flow viewer. It visualizes the output of LLM “thinking” process when solving complex tasks. The State-of-the-Art processes used by LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree-of-thoughts are highly effective, but produce untracklable amount of output for the human operator to check and understand. Process-logger gathers the core decision points and tracks the branches of reasoning process and visualizes them in a simple to interprate graph.
